# NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
# ==========================================================================
# When deploying to Netlify, make sure to:
#
# 1. Add the following environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
#
# 2. Ensure "Build command" is set to:
#    npm run build && npm run inject-env
#
# 3. Make sure the "Base directory" is set to the root of your project
#
# 4. Set "Publish directory" to "out"
#
# 5. Add a netlify.toml file with the following content:
#    [build]
#      command = "npm run build && npm run inject-env"
#      publish = "out"
#
#    [[plugins]]
#      package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
#
# 6. If you experience issues with environment variables not being available:
#    - Check Netlify logs for any errors with environment variable injection
#    - Try testing with Netlify CLI locally using "netlify dev"
#    - Make sure the inject-env script is running after build
#
# 7. For Row Level Security issues with Supabase:
#    - Create appropriate RLS policies in Supabase dashboard
#    - For storage buckets, ensure proper access policies are set
