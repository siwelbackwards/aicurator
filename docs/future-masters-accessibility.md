# Future Masters Page Accessibility Update

## Summary
The Future Masters page has been made publicly accessible without requiring user authentication, similar to the home page.

## Changes Made
- **File Modified**: `components/auth/auth-gate.tsx`
- **Change**: Added `/future-masters` to the `publicPaths` array
- **Impact**: Users can now view the Future Masters page without being prompted to member log in or create an account

## Technical Details
The `AuthGate` component wraps all page content and checks if the current path requires authentication. By adding `/future-masters` to the `publicPaths` array, the page is now treated as a public route that doesn't trigger the authentication overlay.

## Before vs After
**Before**: Visiting `/future-masters` would show a blurred page with an authentication prompt
**After**: Visiting `/future-masters` shows the full page content immediately without any authentication requirements

## User Experience
- ✅ No authentication popup blocking content
- ✅ Immediate access to view emerging artists
- ✅ Consistent with home page accessibility
- ✅ Maintains authentication requirements for other protected pages
