# Authentication-Gated Trending Products

## Overview

This feature implements conditional display of sensitive information (artist names and prices) in the trending products section based on user authentication status. Unauthenticated users will see product titles and images but not artist names or pricing information, encouraging them to member log in for full access.

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `components/home/trending-products.tsx`

### Changes Made

1. **Authentication State Integration**
   - Added `useAuth` hook import from `@/hooks/use-auth`
   - Added `Lock` icon import from `lucide-react`
   - Destructured `isAuthenticated` from the `useAuth` hook

2. **Conditional Content Display**
   - **For Authenticated Users**: Display full product information including:
     - Product title
     - Artist name (prefixed with "By")
     - Price (formatted using `formatPrice` utility or "Price on request")
   
   - **For Unauthenticated Users**: Display limited information with privacy indicators:
     - Product title (always visible)
     - "Artist name hidden" with lock icon
     - "Member log in to see price" with lock icon

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Added visual lock icons to indicate hidden content
   - Used muted gray styling (`text-gray-400`) for placeholder content
   - Added a subtle call-to-action banner below the products grid for unauthenticated users

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Fixed linting warnings by adding proper braces to single-line if statements
   - Maintained consistent code style and formatting

### Technical Implementation

```tsx
// Authentication state check
const { isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

// Conditional rendering logic
{isAuthenticated ? (
  <>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-1">By {product.artist_name}</p>
    <p className="text-lg font-bold text-primary mt-2">
      {product.price ? formatPrice(product.price, product.currency) : 'Price on request'}
    </p>
  </>
) : (
  <>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 mt-1 flex items-center gap-1">
      <Lock className="h-3 w-3" />
      Artist name hidden
    </p>
    <p className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-400 mt-2 flex items-center gap-1">
      <Lock className="h-3 w-3" />
      Member log in to see price
    </p>
  </>
)}
```

### Authentication Integration

The feature leverages the existing authentication system:
- **Authentication Hook**: Uses `useAuth` from `@/hooks/use-auth` for consistent auth state management
- **Session Management**: Inherits from Supabase authentication with session validation
- **Real-time Updates**: Authentication state changes are reflected immediately in the UI

### User Flow

1. **Unauthenticated User**:
   - Visits homepage
   - Sees trending products with titles and images
   - Artist names and prices are hidden with lock icons
   - Sees call-to-action to member log in for full details

2. **Authenticated User**:
   - Visits homepage
   - Sees complete trending products information
   - Can view artist names and pricing
   - No auth prompts are displayed

### Security Considerations

- **Frontend-only Protection**: This is a UX feature, not a security measure
- **Data Still Transmitted**: The complete product data is still sent to the client
- **API Security**: Server-side API endpoints should implement their own authorization
- **Progressive Enhancement**: The feature gracefully degrades if authentication fails

### Styling and Design

- **Consistent Theming**: Uses existing Tailwind classes and design tokens
- **Accessibility**: Maintains proper contrast ratios with gray text
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Lock icons provide clear visual indication of hidden content
- **Responsive Design**: Works across all device sizes

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for this feature:

1. **Server-side Filtering**: Filter sensitive data at the API level for true privacy
2. **Teaser Content**: Show partial artist names (e.g., "By J. Doe")
3. **Price Ranges**: Show price ranges instead of exact prices for unauthenticated users
4. **Authentication Modal**: Click on hidden content to open sign-in modal
5. **Analytics**: Track conversion rates from trending products to sign-ups

### Related Components

This pattern could be extended to other components:
- Product search results
- Featured categories
- Artist profiles
- Product detail pages

### Testing

To test this feature:

1. **Unauthenticated State**:
   - Open the homepage in an incognito window
   - Verify artist names and prices are hidden
   - Confirm lock icons and placeholder text are displayed
   - Check that the auth prompt banner appears

2. **Authenticated State**:
   - Member log in to the application
   - Verify full product information is displayed
   - Confirm no auth prompts are shown
   - Test authentication state persistence across page refreshes

### Dependencies

- `@/hooks/use-auth`: Authentication state management
- `lucide-react`: Lock icon component
- `@/lib/currency-utils`: Price formatting utility
- Existing UI components and styling system
