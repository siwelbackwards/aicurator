## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250120_create_future_masters_artists.sql`
4. Execute the migration
5. Verify the table was created successfully

### 2. Deploy Netlify Functions
1. The functions are already created in `netlify/functions/`
2. Deploy your site to Netlify
3. Functions will be automatically deployed

### 3. Access the System

#### For Users (Public)
- Visit `/future-masters` to see the dynamic artist showcase
- Click "View Full Portfolio" to search for artist's artworks

#### For Admins
- Go to `/admin/future-masters-artists`
- Use the interface to manage artists
- Access from the main admin dashboard via "Future Masters Artists" quick action

## Usage Guide

### Adding a New Artist (Admin)
1. Navigate to Admin → Future Masters Artists
2. Click "Add New Artist"
3. Fill in all required fields:
   - Name, Location, Specialty (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Profile Image URL (required)
   - Search Name (required - used for portfolio searches)
   - Statistics (optional)
   - Recent Work URLs (optional)
4. Set Display Order (lower numbers appear first)
5. Toggle "Active" to show/hide on public page
6. Click "Create Artist"

### Managing Existing Artists
- **Edit**: Click the edit button to modify artist details
- **Toggle Active**: Use the eye/eye-off button to show/hide
- **Delete**: Click delete button (with confirmation)
- **Reorder**: Modify display order numbers

### Portfolio Search Functionality
When users click "View Full Portfolio":
1. System navigates to `/search?q={artist_name_for_search}`
2. Search system queries the `artworks` table for matching `artist_name`
3. Results show all artworks by that artist
4. Includes fuzzy search for typo tolerance

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Public User Experience
- ✅ Visit `/future-masters` - should show artists from database
- ✅ Click "View Full Portfolio" - should navigate to search with artist name
- ✅ Search should return relevant artworks
- ✅ Handle empty state gracefully

### 2. Admin Experience
- ✅ Access `/admin/future-masters-artists` (admin only)
- ✅ Create new artist with all fields
- ✅ Edit existing artist
- ✅ Toggle artist active/inactive status
- ✅ Delete artist with confirmation
- ✅ Form validation works correctly

### 3. Data Flow
- ✅ Database migration creates table correctly
- ✅ API endpoints return proper data structure
- ✅ Frontend handles loading/error states
- ✅ Search integration works seamlessly

## Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Only admins can modify data
- **Admin Role Check**: Interface requires admin privileges
- **Input Validation**: Form validation prevents invalid data
- **CORS Protection**: API endpoints include proper CORS headers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Artists not showing on public page**
   - Check if `is_active` is set to `true`
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible

2. **Portfolio search returns no results**
   - Check `artist_name_for_search` matches artwork `artist_name` field
   - Verify artworks exist in database with matching artist name

3. **Admin interface not accessible**
   - Ensure user has admin role in profiles table
   - Check authentication status

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify database table exists and has data
3. Test API endpoints directly
4. Check Netlify function logs

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the system:
- Image upload instead of URL input
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Artist biography rich text editor
- Social media links integration
- Portfolio preview in admin interface
- Analytics on artist views/clicks

## Migration from Static to Dynamic

The system automatically includes the original hardcoded artists:
- Elena Rossi
- Yayoi Kusama
- Ai Weiwei
- Olafur Eliasson

These will be available immediately after running the database migration. Admins can then modify, deactivate, or remove them as needed.
