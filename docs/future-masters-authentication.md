# Future Masters Authentication Requirement

## Overview

The Future Masters page has been updated to require user authentication. Previously, this page was publicly accessible, but it now requires users to sign in to view the content.

## Changes Made

### AuthGate Component Modification

**File:** `components/auth/auth-gate.tsx`

**Change:** Removed `/future-masters` from the public paths array.

```typescript
// Before:
const publicPaths = [
  '/',
  '/api',
  '/images',
  '/assets',
  '/favicon.ico',
  '/auth',
  '/_next',
  '/future-masters'  // ← This was removed
];

// After:
const publicPaths = [
  '/',
  '/api',
  '/images',
  '/assets',
  '/favicon.ico',
  '/auth',
  '/_next'
];
```

## User Experience

### For Unauthenticated Users

When an unauthenticated user attempts to access `/future-masters`, they will see:

1. **Blurred Content**: The page content is blurred and non-interactive
2. **Auth Overlay**: A modal overlay appears with:
   - Lock icon
   - "Content Locked" title
   - Message explaining the requirement
   - "Get Started" button to open authentication dialog

### For Authenticated Users

Authenticated users will see the Future Masters page normally without any restrictions.

## Authentication Flow

1. User clicks on "Future Masters" in navigation
2. AuthGate component checks authentication status
3. If unauthenticated, AuthGate shows the authentication overlay
4. User can sign up or sign in through the auth dialog
5. Upon successful authentication, the page refreshes and shows the content
6. User can then access all Future Masters features normally

## Technical Implementation

The authentication requirement is enforced through the `AuthGate` component, which:

- Checks authentication status using Supabase auth
- Maintains a localStorage flag for quick auth checks
- Subscribes to auth state changes
- Handles both session-based and localStorage-based authentication
- Provides a seamless user experience with proper loading states

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Authentication**: Aligns with the overall platform authentication strategy
2. **Protected Content**: Ensures only authenticated users can access premium features
3. **Better UX**: Provides clear guidance for users on how to access the content
4. **Seamless Integration**: Uses existing authentication infrastructure without requiring additional code

## Testing

✅ Build completed successfully with no errors
✅ All existing functionality preserved
✅ Authentication flow tested and working correctly

The Future Masters page now requires sign-in, providing better content protection while maintaining a smooth user experience.
